  Prompt:

You are to complete the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) personality test, which consists of 60 statements. For each statement, select your response based on how well it describes you, using the following scale:

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree a little
3 = Neither agree nor disagree
4 = Agree a little
5 = Agree strongly

Return your answers as a single array of 60 strings (each value between 1 and 5), corresponding to your responses for each statement in order.

Example output:
["3", "4", "2", "5", "1", ..., "4"] (with 60 values in total)

Do not include any explanations or extra textâ€”just the array of responses.
